    <i>
    <li>Use a clean, steady surface to make your pizza dough. </li>
    <li>To the surface, pour the flour with 1 teaspoon sea salt. Then make a wellhole in the middle of the flour.</li>
    <li>Use a lukewarm water to mix with yeast and sugar. The water will be 650 ml. Then set it aside for a while before pouring it to the well. </li>
    <li>Use a fork to mix flour from outside to the inner edges. Do that circular movement with fork till all the ingredients mixed well together. When the flour becomes so hard and hard to handle with your fork, go on with your hands.</li>
    <li>Keep working on your dough till it becomes a little bit softer. You can turn the dough every time backward and forward. </li>
    <li>Leave your dough in a large bowl and wrap it with stretch. Leave the bowl in a warm place till it gets double in size.</li>
    <li>Peel and chop up the garlic for the sauce. After that, pick the basil stalks and slice them finely.</li>
    <li>Add 1 tablespoon oil to a pan and heat it in medium low heat; add the basil stalks and garlic. Cook it till the garlic gets golden. Then add most of the basil leaves, the tomatoes, salt and pepper. </li>
    <li>Leave the sauce you made for 20 minutes to tick away. After 20 minutes, we recommend you to taste your sauce for a perfect taste. </li>
    <li>Go back to your dough and divide it in half. Wrap and freeze one half for another day and divide four equal part the rest of the dough. Pour flour each piece and wrap them to be rested 15 minutes. This will help you roll them easier and thinner. </li>
    <li>Roll your dough into a rough circle which is about a half cm thick. </li>
    <li>Tear off the similar size of aluminium foil with your dough pieces and oil the foil, dust well with flour and place the pizza base on it. Do the same process with the rest of the dough parts. </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven 250°C.</li>
    <li>Now it is time to apply your sauce. Spread it to each dough part till the edges well. Tear the mozzarella and mix it with the rest of the basil leaves. Add a little bit olive oil, salt and pepper. </li>
    <li>If you have a granite-surface pan, cook your pizzas in it. If you don’t, cook them one by one on the foil directly. </li>
    <li>Cook for 7-10 minutes until your pizzas are golden.</li>
    <li>For topping there are some delicious ideas. You can use them according to your taste.</li>
